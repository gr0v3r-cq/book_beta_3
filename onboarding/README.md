# Onboarding

Intermediate level. A unique onboarding flow designed for the Fun with Flutter YouTube channel.

It makes use of the [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) package for state management. The unique drawing is achieved with a [Custom Painter](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/CustomPaint-class.html).
